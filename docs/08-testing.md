# Testing Documentation

## Overview

The Groupie Tracker application implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality, functionality, and reliability. This document details the testing approaches, tools, and best practices used in the project.

## Testing Approach

The application uses the following testing approaches:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and components in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between different components.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the complete application flow.
4. **Manual Testing**: Manual verification of functionality and user experience.

## Testing Tools

The application uses Go's built-in testing framework for automated tests. See the import statement in the test files:

```go
import "testing"
```

## Test Files

The application includes several test files:

1. [`api/artist_test.go`](../api/artist_test.go): Tests for artist-related functionality.
2. [`api/dates_test.go`](../api/dates_test.go): Tests for date-related functionality.
3. [`api/locations_test.go`](../api/locations_test.go): Tests for location-related functionality.
4. [`api/relations_test.go`](../api/relations_test.go): Tests for relation-related functionality.
5. [`cmd/main_test.go`](../cmd/main_test.go): Tests for the main application.

## Unit Tests

### Artist Handler Tests

See the tests in [`api/artist_test.go`](../api/artist_test.go).

Key aspects:
- Creating HTTP requests to test handlers
- Using ResponseRecorder to capture responses
- Checking status codes and response content
- Testing different scenarios (valid and invalid inputs)

### Geocoding Tests

See the tests in [`api/geocode_test.go`](../api/geocode_test.go).

Key aspects:
- Testing geocoding with known locations
- Verifying that coordinates are reasonable
- Testing error handling for invalid locations

### Cache Tests

See the cache tests in [`api/geocode_test.go`](../api/geocode_test.go).

Key aspects:
- Clearing the cache before testing
- Verifying that locations are not in cache initially
- Geocoding a location and checking that it's added to the cache
- Verifying that subsequent calls use the cached result

## Integration Tests

See the integration tests in the test files.

Key aspects:
- Testing interactions between components
- Testing search functionality with different queries
- Verifying that components work together correctly

## End-to-End Tests

See the end-to-end tests in [`cmd/main_test.go`](../cmd/main_test.go).

Key aspects:
- Starting the server
- Making HTTP requests to different endpoints
- Verifying responses
- Testing the complete application flow

## Test Coverage

The application aims for high test coverage to ensure code quality and reliability. Test coverage can be measured using Go's built-in coverage tool:

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

## Mocking

For tests that involve external dependencies, the application uses mocking to isolate the code being tested. See examples in the test files.

Key aspects:
- Creating mock implementations of functions
- Providing controlled test data
- Isolating the code being tested from external dependencies

## Test Fixtures

The application uses test fixtures to provide consistent test data. See examples in the test files.

Key aspects:
- Defining test data structures
- Reusing test data across multiple tests
- Ensuring consistent test conditions

## Test Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be isolated from others.
2. **Deterministic**: Tests should produce the same results each time they are run.
3. **Fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing.
4. **Comprehensive**: Tests should cover all important code paths.
5. **Readable**: Tests should be easy to understand.
6. **Maintainable**: Tests should be easy to maintain as the code evolves.

## Continuous Integration

The application can be integrated with continuous integration (CI) systems to run tests automatically on code changes.

Example GitHub Actions workflow:
- Triggered on push to main branch and pull requests
- Sets up Go environment
- Runs tests and measures coverage
- Reports test results

## Manual Testing

In addition to automated tests, the application should be manually tested to ensure a good user experience:

1. **Functionality Testing**: Verify that all features work as expected.
2. **Usability Testing**: Ensure the application is easy to use.
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Test the application on different browsers and devices.
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify that the application performs well under load.
5. **Security Testing**: Check for security vulnerabilities.

## Test-Driven Development

The application follows test-driven development (TDD) principles:

1. **Write Tests First**: Write tests before implementing features.
2. **Run Tests**: Run tests to verify they fail.
3. **Implement Features**: Implement features to make tests pass.
4. **Refactor**: Refactor code while ensuring tests continue to pass.

## Regression Testing

The application includes regression tests to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality. See examples in the test files.

Key aspects:
- Testing specific issues that were fixed
- Ensuring that fixes don't break other functionality
- Preventing regressions in future changes

## Performance Testing

The application includes performance tests to ensure it performs well. See benchmark tests in the test files.

Key aspects:
- Measuring the performance of critical functions
- Ensuring that performance meets requirements
- Identifying performance bottlenecks

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
go test -run TestGeocodeLocation ./api
```

To run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=. ./api
```
